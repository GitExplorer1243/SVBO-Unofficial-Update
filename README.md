# SVBO-Unofficial-Update
This is the github repo of an unofficial update to Theoddon's mod, Stardew Valley Balance Overhaul.

Why this update?

Well, ever since July of 2024, Theoddon has been studying a second language. This resulted in the mod not receiving any updates, even when the SVE 1.15 update came, which made it's own new content not balanced. As Theo said, his "mods AND spreadsheet are free use. If someone feels they can maintain the vision of this mod, they are more than welcome to use what I have created!"

Well, I did just that!

What does this new update contain than the original mod?

Well, in fact, the mod now contains the SVE 1.15 content that has now been rebalanced to closely fit Theo's style. All crops, fruit and wild trees, items, recipes, food, and even farm buildings and animals have been done. It will also rebalance more SVE content such as shops and the new food and other consumables such as the Dewdrop Berry.

Also, more vanilla 1.6 content has been done, like the three new monsters and the new fish.

But wait! There's more! There's also built in content for more mods, coming down the line. I (possibly a few weeks or possibly a month after this mod's release) plan on doing my take on Cornucopia and add content for the new crops and flowers, the artisan products, and even the artisan machines for the first time in Cornucopia rebalancing history, and coming soon, the 300+ new cooking recipes that will be coming in the fourth mod of the suite. Other mods that might be rebalanced would be "Visit Mount Vapius", "Animal Husbandry" and more.

Like always, as with the official version of SVBO, a new save is required for the intended experience. If you want to see the new content this unofficial update of this mod adds, I have made an unofficial version of Theo's spreadsheet here.
